This website is for calculating the curve for AICE grading thresholds.

### AICE Curves

There is a max amount of marks(or points) you can achieve on an AICE test, and out of those there are thresholds for each individual letter grade. This calculator is made to automatically scale down the curve depending on the new amount of max points and all the old respective ratios.

Manual calculation is easy, if I started with the following values:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Marks</th>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>C</th>
    <th>D</th>
    <th>E</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>50</th>
    <th>40</th>
    <th>30</th>
    <th>20</th>
    <th>10</th>
    <th>5</th>
  </tr>
</table>

and I wanted to remove a couple questions, so my new amount of marks is 40:

-   Calculate the ratio between old marks and new marks = NEW MARKS / OLD MARKS

    -   For this example it would be 40/50 = .8

-   Multiply that value to each grade threshold for each letter
    -   40 \* .8
    -   30 \* .8
    -   20 \* .8
    -   10 \* .8
    -   5 \* .8

And our new table would look something like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Marks</th>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>C</th>
    <th>D</th>
    <th>E</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>40</th>
    <th>32</th>
    <th>24</th>
    <th>16</th>
    <th>8</th>
    <th>4</th>
  </tr>
</table>
